How to use the virtual machine
-------------------------------

- "vagrant up" will start a new virtual machine in virtualbox matching a template in this repository.
- This will download an ubuntu image once and then it'll be saved on your hard drive.
- "vagrant ssh" will drop you into a shell on the virtual machine, but this usually isn't necessary.
- "vagrant destroy" will shutdown and remove the virtual machine.

- The template has the following pre-installed:
    -   apache2

    -   mysql
    -   django
