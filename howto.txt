Setting up django development on your machine
----------------------------------------------
Install Python version 3 or higher.
	- https://www.python.org/download/releases/
	- In my example, mine is installed at C:\Python33.

Add Python directories to your PATH environemnt variable.
	- C:\Python33;C:\Python33\Scripts;C:\Python33\DLLs
	- If yours isn't in Python33 this will be different (which is likely).
	- The following powershell will accomplish this:
	- [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python33\;C:\Python33\Scripts\;C:\PYTHON33\DLLs\;C:\PYTHON33\LIB\;", "Machine")

Install easy_install and pip.
	- These are python package managers and they will make your life much easier.
	- easy_install:
		- If you are on Windows 8+, use this powershell and it will install the latest:
			- (Invoke-WebRequest https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py).Content | python -
		- If you're not, download this python script and run it:
			- https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py

	- pip:
		- Run "easy_install pip" in a console.
		- If that doesn't work it's either because easy_install wasn't setup correctly or the Python\Scripts folder is not in your PATH.

Install Django.
	- pip install django
	- FIXME: mysql-python is only for 2.x python, what do I use?
		- https://github.com/davispuh/MySQL-for-Python-3
		- I'd like to use PyMySQL: https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/
		- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2636536/how-to-make-django-work-with-unsupported-mysql-drivers-such-as-gevent-mysql-or-c
	- pip install mysql-python
	- 

git clone https://github.com/davispuh/MySQL-for-Python-3.git

Install Mysql server.
	- http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
	- The MSI installer is probably easier.

Setup a new Mysql database and user.
	- foo
	- bar
